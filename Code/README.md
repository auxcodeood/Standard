# Code

## Principles

* These coding standards are minimalistic
* They follow the Parato principle
  * If we take care of the few most imortan things, the rest will solve itself. 

## We are a service company

* We sell neither coding nor code, but solutions via service

## Work w/ the customer on what they need, not what they want 

* Includes Roadmap w/ Timine

## Comments

## 1-5 rows between {} 

## One function does one thing 

## Refactoring is part of every DO

* No "we need now six months to refactor"
  * This drives the customers mad
  * It is very difficult to impossible to budget and justify (unless it brings direct value to the business, which such kind of refactoring does not) 

## Be a DOer and a Mentor

## Contunuously Improve
