# Aux Standard Recommendation for Flutter

## Summary

https://flutter.dev

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)

## 4-in-1

One codebase can be compiled for four platforms:

* iOS
* Android
* www
* Desktop

Saves _at least_ 50% of the effort/budget, compared to developing individually for each platform.

All developers must know one technology, compared to developing individually for each platform.

* Much easier access to talent.
* Much easer crew and resources management.

Quality

* Quality is a particular benefit for Flutter, only one application needs to be extensively tested, compared to native apps, where iOS, Android, www and Desktop must be tested separately.

## Modern

Current State of the Art.

Since 2017.

Modern Framework (Flutter) and Programming Language (Dart) which contain improvements compared to previous Frameworks and Programming Languages.

* Great motivation for the programmers, because they use current and future tools and approaches.

## Indistingushable from Native Performance

Rendering is made with speeds of 60 FPS / 120 FPS.

## Fast Development Process 

Hot Reload

* Every code change is immediately visible w/o time to rebuild.

Many UI Widgets Available

* Native widgets for every platform (for example iOS, Android), which are very easy to use.

Excellent UI

* Prebuild widgets offer great UI even without spending much time on designing.

Debugger and DevTools

* Just like browsers, Flutter has the possibility to debug and inspect applications to boost development speed.

IDE support

* Crucial point for developers, helping them write code faster and efficient.

Integration w/ Firebase.

## Vast Community

Flutter's documentation is very well-written and can be used from junior to senior.

Plenty of forums, tutorials, plugins.
